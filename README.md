## Support this project

moneynotlove is a platform for young creatives. Many creatives face the same problems: invoicing, accounting, insurances, salary negotiation etc. By offering a platform for knowledge exchange, we ease the creative work of everyone.

All information on the platform is available for free. We assembled it ourselves and hope to answer the most common questions. But it is far from perfect. You have surely found something that could be improved or that's missing completely. Now is your time! Follow this simple instructions to help us improve moneynotlove.


## Getting started

In this github repository, we store the content of the individual web pages. Browse through the different folders in /pages and you will find the same pages as on the live platform. Feel free to make any changes you like. If we agree, we will approve them and update the live site! There is no danger that you will brake anything.


## Edit the files

Most of the files look just like simple text. But you might notice some strange letters. This is because we format the pages with the markdown syntax. There are many tutorials online - it's so easy you will get the hang of it quickly. To start, have a look at this [Cheatsheet](https://moneynotlove.ch/cheatsheet).
